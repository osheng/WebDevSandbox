I heard it's possible to set up a server in C. I wanted to try it and see what I could build on it.

I got the server to run locally. It sends a chunk of HTML to any browser which connects to it, which the browser then renders.

Originally, I also wanted to set the server to be publicly visible, and then I learned that was a bad idea.

Things I would like to do next:
* Get the server to send a different page to each browser which connects, depending on its user-agent.

* Learn to send not just a long string of HTML, but entire packets.

* Learn to make requests for specific information from a server from within a webpage.
